# Ableton MCP Pro

Full control of Ableton Live through AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Create tracks, program MIDI, load instruments, mix, automate, and record arrangements — all from natural language.

### Demo Tracks

- [claude_hardgroove](https://soundcloud.com/nicholasbien/claude_hardgroove)
- [claude_song1](https://soundcloud.com/nicholasbien/claude_song1)
- [claude_downtempo](https://soundcloud.com/nicholasbien/claude_downtempo)

Forked from [uisato/ableton-mcp-extended](https://github.com/uisato/ableton-mcp-extended), inspired by [ahujasid/ableton-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/ableton-mcp).

## What's New

This fork adds significant capabilities beyond the original:

- **Direct arrangement editing** — Read, place, and delete clips in arrangement view without going through session-view recording. Drop audio samples by file path and MIDI clips with notes seeded inline.
- **Arrangement recording** — Record session clips into the arrangement with bar-accurate scene transitions, with `start_time` to append past existing material
- **Arrangement view** — Read arrangement info, clips per track (with `file_path` for audio clips), full arrangement state; control loop, overdub, song position, and back-to-arranger
- **Arrangement playback** — Dedicated `play_arrangement` command that switches to arrangement view
- **Smooth automation envelopes** — Interpolated ramps between points (not just flat steps)
- **Full mixing** — Volume, panning, sends, mute, solo, arm for all tracks including master and returns
- **Master/return track support** — Use `track_index: -1` for master, `-2`/`-3` for return tracks across all mixing commands
- **Scene management** — Create, delete, rename, and fire scenes for arrangement workflows
- **Track management** — Create/delete/duplicate MIDI and audio tracks
- **Clip operations** — Duplicate, delete, rename, loop control, get/set notes
- **Device control** — Get/set any device parameter, batch updates, delete devices
- **Browser integration** — Browse and load instruments, effects, and presets by URI
- **Transport controls** — Tempo, time signature, metronome, record mode
- **Undo/redo** support

See [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md) for the full feature list and roadmap.

## Music Production Skills

When used with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), this project includes 20 production skills that guide Claude through genre-specific workflows — from sound design to pattern programming to mixing. Each skill provides specific, actionable parameter values.

### Using Skills

Skills activate automatically based on what you ask. Examples:

- *"Make me a techno beat"* → triggers techno-drums
- *"Add an acid bassline"* → triggers acid-bass
- *"Let's mix this track"* → triggers mixing-guide
- *"Make some dreamy pads"* → triggers ethereal-pads

Skills can also be combined — ask for "techno drums and bass" and Claude will use both techno-drums and techno-bass skills together.

### Creating Your Own Skills

See the [Skill Authoring Guide](SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) for best practices on creating new skills.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ableton Live 11+ (any edition)
- Python 3.10+
- pip (use a current release)

### Security defaults in this fork

This fork is **read-only by default** in both the MCP process and the Remote
Script running inside Ableton. It also redacts absolute audio-file paths,
limits clients and message sizes, and requires per-call confirmation for
destructive tools. Port 9877 intentionally has no authentication, but is bound
explicitly to `127.0.0.1`; disable the control surface when it is not in use.

Safety settings are read once when each process starts:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---:|---|
| `ABLETON_MCP_READ_ONLY` | `1` | Blocks every state-changing command |
| `ABLETON_MCP_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` | `0` | Additional gate for deletion/clearing tools |
| `ABLETON_MCP_REDACT_FILE_PATHS` | `1` | Replaces absolute audio paths with `<redacted>` |
| `ABLETON_MCP_ALLOW_CUSTOM_MODEL_SOURCE` | `0` | Blocks caller-selected model repositories |

To compose or mix, set `ABLETON_MCP_READ_ONLY=0` for **both** Ableton and the
MCP server, then restart both. To delete or clear content, additionally set
`ABLETON_MCP_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1`; every destructive tool call must still pass
`confirm_destructive=true` after explicit user confirmation.

On macOS, GUI applications do not normally inherit shell variables. Set the
Ableton-side values before launching Live, for example:

```bash
launchctl setenv ABLETON_MCP_READ_ONLY 0
launchctl setenv ABLETON_MCP_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE 0
launchctl setenv ABLETON_MCP_REDACT_FILE_PATHS 1
```

For a managed work computer, obtain employer approval first and keep path
redaction enabled. Track names, notes, device settings, and other Live-set data
returned by tools can still be sent to the configured AI provider.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoJoVe/ableton-mcp-pro.git
cd ableton-mcp-pro
```

Install the core server into a dedicated environment using the hash-locked
dependency set:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
```

The optional AI dependency graph is captured in `pylock.ai.toml` for Python
3.12 on Apple Silicon. Regenerate it for a different platform before use.

### 2. Install the Remote Script in Ableton

Copy the Remote Script into Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts folder:

**Mac:**
```bash
mkdir -p "/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/AbletonMCP"
cp AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py "/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/AbletonMCP/__init__.py"
```

**Windows:**
```
Copy AbletonMCP_Remote_Script\__init__.py to:
C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 12 Suite\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\AbletonMCP\__init__.py
```

> Adjust the path for your Ableton version (Live 11, Live 12, Suite vs Standard, etc).

### 3. Enable in Ableton

1. Open Ableton Live
2. Go to **Preferences** > **Link, Tempo & MIDI**
3. Set a **Control Surface** slot to **AbletonMCP**
4. Leave Input and Output set to **None**

You should see "AbletonMCP: Listening for commands on port 9877" in the status bar.

### 4. Connect your AI assistant

#### Claude Code (CLI)

Add to your `.mcp.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AbletonMCP": {
        "command": "/path/to/ableton-mcp-pro/.venv/bin/python",
        "args": [
          "/path/to/ableton-mcp-pro/MCP_Server/server.py"
        ],
        "env": {
          "ABLETON_MCP_READ_ONLY": "1",
          "ABLETON_MCP_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE": "0",
          "ABLETON_MCP_REDACT_FILE_PATHS": "1"
        }
      }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AbletonMCP": {
        "command": "/path/to/ableton-mcp-pro/.venv/bin/python",
        "args": [
          "/path/to/ableton-mcp-pro/MCP_Server/server.py"
        ],
        "env": {
          "ABLETON_MCP_READ_ONLY": "1",
          "ABLETON_MCP_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE": "0",
          "ABLETON_MCP_REDACT_FILE_PATHS": "1"
        }
      }
  }
}
```

> Replace `/path/to/ableton-mcp-pro` with the actual path where you cloned the repo.

#### Cursor

Add an MCP server in **Settings > MCP** with the same command and args as above.

### 5. Try it

Open your AI assistant and try:
- "What tracks do I have?"
- "Create a MIDI track, load Analog on it, and program a bass line"
- "Set the tempo to 128 and add a compressor to the master"

## How It Works

```
AI Assistant --> MCP Server (Python) --> TCP socket (port 9877) --> Remote Script (inside Ableton)
```

1. You give a natural language instruction to your AI assistant
2. The assistant calls MCP tools like `create_clip`, `add_notes_to_clip`, `set_device_parameter`
3. The MCP server sends JSON commands over TCP to the Remote Script running inside Ableton
4. The Remote Script executes commands using Ableton's Live Object Model (LOM)

## Available Tools

### Read
`get_session_info`, `get_track_info`, `get_device_parameters`, `get_arrangement_info`, `get_arrangement_clips`, `get_full_arrangement`, `get_clip_notes`, `get_arrangement_clip_notes`, `get_clip_envelope`, `get_browser_tree`, `get_browser_items_at_path`

### Modify
`create_midi_track`, `create_audio_track`, `create_clip`, `create_audio_clip`, `add_notes_to_clip`, `set_clip_name`, `set_clip_loop`, `delete_clip`, `delete_arrangement_clip`, `duplicate_clip`, `delete_track`, `duplicate_track`, `set_track_name`, `set_track_volume`, `set_track_panning`, `set_track_mute`, `set_track_solo`, `set_track_arm`, `set_send_level`, `set_tempo`, `set_time_signature`, `set_metronome`, `fire_clip`, `stop_clip`, `fire_scene`, `create_scene`, `delete_scene`, `set_scene_name`, `start_playback`, `stop_playback`, `play_arrangement`, `load_instrument_or_effect`, `set_device_parameter`, `batch_set_device_parameters`, `delete_device`, `set_song_time`, `set_record_mode`, `set_arrangement_overdub`, `set_back_to_arranger`, `set_arrangement_loop`, `set_clip_envelope`, `clear_clip_envelope`, `undo`, `redo`

### Arrangement
The arrangement view supports a **full read-modify-write loop directly**, no session-view round-trip required:

- `get_arrangement_clips(track_index)` — list clips on a track with `start_time`, `length`, and (for audio) `file_path` of the source sample.
- `get_arrangement_clip_notes(track_index, arrangement_clip_index)` — read MIDI notes from any arrangement clip.
- `create_arrangement_audio_clip(track_index, file_path, time, length?)` — place a sample directly at a beat position. Pair with `file_path` from `get_arrangement_clips` to clone/remix existing samples.
- `create_arrangement_midi_clip(track_index, time, length, notes?)` — create a MIDI clip and (optionally) seed all notes inline in one call.
- `delete_arrangement_clip(track_index, arrangement_clip_index)` — remove a clip by index.
- `record_arrangement(sections, start_time?)` — record session scenes into arrangement with bar-accurate transitions; `start_time` appends past existing material instead of overwriting from beat 0.

#### Session vs. arrangement workflow

Both views are useful — pick based on what you're doing:

- **Use session view** for iteration: building a chord progression, dialing in a drum pattern, A/B-ing variations, or anywhere the agent benefits from tight `create_clip` → `add_notes_to_clip` → `fire_clip` loops where the user can hear changes immediately.
- **Use arrangement view** for the final song structure: build, drops, breaks, transitions. Once a section is right, the agent should prefer `create_arrangement_midi_clip` / `create_arrangement_audio_clip` to place the section directly in arrangement at the target beat position rather than re-recording session clips. This keeps the timeline clean (no overdubbed takes), avoids overwriting existing arrangement material, and lets the agent edit the final song surgically — read what's there with `get_arrangement_clips` / `get_arrangement_clip_notes`, swap or delete with `delete_arrangement_clip`, and place new material at exact beat positions.

## Updating the Remote Script

When you modify `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py`:

```bash
cp AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py "/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/AbletonMCP/__init__.py"
rm -rf "/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/AbletonMCP/__pycache__"
```

Then **fully restart Ableton** (toggling the Control Surface in preferences doesn't reliably reload the script).

## AI Melody Generation

`tools/midigenai_bridge.py` is a CLI that pipes Ableton clip notes through
the [midigenai](https://github.com/nicholasbien/midigenai) package
(v2 model, weights on
[huggingface.co/nicholasbien/midigenai](https://huggingface.co/nicholasbien/midigenai))
to generate melody continuations. The agent reads a clip with
`get_clip_notes`, shells out to the bridge, and writes the result back with
`add_notes_to_clip` — no MCP server changes needed. See
[tools/README.md](tools/README.md) for setup, dependencies, and usage.

## Known Limitations

- **Arrangement clips are read-only** — The LOM can't create/delete arrangement clips directly. Use `record_arrangement` to record from session, or record an empty scene to erase.
- **Audio clip loading** — `ClipSlot.create_clip()` only accepts a length (for MIDI clips), not file paths. Audio clips must be dragged manually from Ableton's browser.
- **Stale song reference** — First command after an Ableton restart may fail (retry works). The script auto-refreshes its internal reference.
